<br/>“Sue was extremely knowledgeable and professional in all aspects of the negotiation. I would not hesitate to use Sue in the future and I recommend her to anyone needing professional legal assistance.”<br/>
 
<br/>“Sue was very pleasant and professional .  I would definitely recommend Sue for your legal needs.”<br/>
 <br/>
“She was always available, quick to respond, and guided us when we weren't sure. She made it a painless and easy process and I highly recommended her.”<br/>
<br/> 
“I was referred to Sue Hankins. That introduction changed my opinion of Attourney's. I'm so happy that I decided to hire Sue to handle aspects of the business with my husband and I.  If you’re looking for the best you want to call Sue.  Sue is to us a right hand we don't want to live without. 
I trust Sue with all of my business. She has proven to be the person that will work hard for us to be sure we're protected and secure. 
Take our word for it you won't be disappointed.”<br/>
 <br/>
“Extremely competent and efficient. I was able to position myself and business to expand ahead of schedule due to her diligence and business law acumen. Her command of the business legal landscape and what one needs to put in play for a growing 10 year business was priceless! I have become better informed and obtained a greater understanding of what I need to do and what needs to be done in terms of my agreements with investors, website legalities, business structure, and more! It is almost hard to believe this kind of value is available, as she is mindful of clients time and works efficiently with you keeping your objective in perspective. She clearly loves what she does, has very high standards and is easy to talk to! What peace of mind I now have after her help! Thank you Sue for assisting me with business growth and continued success in my business.”
 <br/>
“Peace of mind”<br/>
 <br/>
“Great Patience Lead to A Great Experience”<br/>
